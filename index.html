      <h3>about</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I am a cognitive scientist studying compositionality and the architecture of large language models in the Lab for Mind, Brain, and Computation at Dartmouth College.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I was at Harvard, where I was a research associate at Harvard Business School specializing in business ethics. While at Harvard, I received my M.Div. and was a member of the Joshua Greene Lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a first-generation college student at Middlebury College and trained as a research scientist in laboratories at Harvard Medical School and the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond my academic research, I enjoy working with large language models and previously did work as a model teacher for OpenAI.
