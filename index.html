      <h3>about</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>I'm an associate at <a href="https://chernikgroup.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#1DA1F2">The Chernik Group</a>, a fully remote private practice of academic coaches, tutors, and writers specializing in executive functioning and habit formation.</p>
      <p>As a cognitive scientist, I study compositionality and the architecture of large language models in the Lab for Mind, Brain, and Computation at Dartmouth College.</p>
      <p>Previously, I was at Harvard, where I was a research associate at HBS specializing in business ethics. While at Harvard, I received my M.Div. and was a member of the Joshua Greene Lab.</p>
      <p>I was a first generation college student at Middlebury College and trained as a research scientist in laboratories at Harvard Medical School and the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Beyond my academic research, I love to play with large language models and did some work as a model teacher for OpenAI.</p>
